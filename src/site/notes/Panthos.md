#place/panthos 
A powerful empire north of [[Bonnurka\|Bonnurka]] and north west of [[The Shogonate\|The Shogonate]]. Known as the spiritual home of the [[Pantheon of Anguun\|Pantheon of Anguun]] gods, and styled somewhere between and ancient greek / khmer culture. Thriving in art and culture, but deeply connected to the work of the many gods and their relationship with nature, and their influence on daily life. Also home to the [[Automatoa\|Automatoa]], arcane robot constructs made of stone, metal or (typically wood) organics.

# Axioms

## Grandeur and inequity

This is a land of immensity - cities, heroes, stories, and an acceptance that not all reach that. However, those born into the lower forms may still find the attention of the gods and be remade anew. 

## The gods meddle

The gods sometimes walk the earth, and have their own particular interests. Attracting their attention is rare, but can change one's life dramatically and redirected the course of history. 

## A life watched, for shame or glory

People of Panthos live an observed life - although the gods are generally not-interested in everyone's doing, there is the constant feeling that any action may be observed, even when alone. Morals are intertwined with how their deeds are seen by the gods, and what this might mean for one's next life - be that in the next world or spun back into this one for the gods desire, testing, or amusement.

# Key moments in history

## The blasphemy of [[Oamella Keld\|Oamella Keld]]

800 years ago the priestess [[Oamella Keld\|Oamella Keld]] had a revelation - this pantheon of gods is not of this world. They are no more special to this place than any person, and have simply made their home here. Their power is borrowed, not created. She was cast out and since known here as [[Oamella Keld\|the Heretic]].

## The Silence

40 years ago the gods went silent. This was in conjunction with a [[3 star alignment\|3 star alignment]]. Since then the rulers of [[Panthos\|Panthos]] have lost some sway over the population, as one of the pillars of control - the various churches of the lands - become first unable to call upon divine insight into the future, and later even the capacity to heal the sick.  

Some regions have had to tighten their rule on the populous to quell uprising and discontent. Acts of nature, such as the failure of crops, without the comfort of the divine has left many seeking answers from those in power. A sect called [[Absconditus a Diis\|Absconditus a Diis]] (the hidden from god) has arisen in various parts - calling on a more complete severence in communication between the people of [[Panthos\|Panthos]] and [[Pantheon of Anguun\|The Pantheon]], and war in the southern border between [[Eos\|Eos]] and [[Neduyar\|Neduyar]] has erupted between those two nations and the emerging sect. Others have reacted just as extreme, but in the other direction. In [[Tajut\|Tajut]] the [[Yutahirin\|Yutahirin]] (those that purify themselves) have begun seeking to redeem the world in the eyes of the gods. This has resulted in atrocitices to the south in [[Derudara\|Derudara]], the umbral lands, where the Drow and Kenku are already seen as lesser beings, and the practice of shadow magic as evil by the holy in [[Tajut\|Tajut]].

## The abduction of [[Urdua Cardano\|Urdua Cardano]], the crown prince of [[Port Mern\|Port Mern]]

The crown prince of [[Port Mern\|Port Mern]], [[Urdua Cardano\|Urdua Cardano]] son of [[Walua Cardano\|Walua Cardano]], dissappeared from [[Port Mern\|Port Mern]] at the same time a trade envoy from [[Eos\|Eos]] was in the northwestern city of [[Bonnurka\|Bonnurka]]. Suspicion quickly went to the trade envoy from [[Eos\|Eos]], as the negotiations had broken down between the sharing of [[Automatoa\|Automatoa]] crafting secrets with the [[Mechanalocks\|Mechanalocks]], amongst other disputes. Messages and envoys have been traded between the two nations over the past 18 months, however the [[Eos\|Eosans]] claim not to hold [[Urdua Cardano\|Urdua Cardano]], and yet he still remains missing. [[Walua Cardano\|Walua Cardano]] has been overseeing heavy reinforcements of [[Port Mern\|Port Mern]]'s already strong naval force, whilst the [[Eos\|Eosans]] have sent spies and hunters to attempt to find [[Urdua Cardano\|Urdua]] and seek to sure up defensive treaties with their neighbours, should [[Walua Cardano\|Cardano]] seek to invade. 

# Regions

## [[Eos\|Eos]]
