Consider: #todo: check this https://jonwake.blogspot.com/2018/07/minimal-viable-character-for-vampire.html - sample below. Mix in with the one above to make a system here. 
Called a "minimum viable character" by the original author, each bio includes:

- a name and a basic concept
- a twist on that concept
- a pivotal life event that continues to influence the character, as well as some insight into how the character feels about the event, and why they can't let it go
- something about the character that is likely to stick out in the minds of others when they first meet
- an issue the character feels strongly about, and how they are likely to react when they encounter it

# Description

- **“What”:** What are they doing in this particular place at this particular time? 

- **“Who”:** Which player are they ‘attached’ to? They don’t need to be connected to all the PCs or have a deep connection, but something about at least one PC should ‘trigger’ them (or trigger the player character). 

- **“How”:** How did they become who they are today? What led them to have the ability strengths/weaknesses and emotional demeanor? 

- _(Optional):_ **_“Will”:_** _Will they give the party a mission or any items they need?_
