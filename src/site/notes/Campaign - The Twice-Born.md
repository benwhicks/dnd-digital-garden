## The Silence

40 years ago the gods went silent. This was in conjunction with a [[3 star alignment\|3 star alignment]]. Since then the rulers of [[Panthos\|Panthos]] have lost some sway over the population, as one of the pillars of control - the various churches of the lands - become first unable to call upon divine insight into the future, and later even the capacity to heal the sick.  

Some regions have had to tighten their rule on the populous to quell uprising and discontent. Acts of nature, such as the failure of crops, without the comfort of the divine has left many seeking answers from those in power. A sect called [[Absconditus a Diis\|Absconditus a Diis]] (the hidden from god) has arisen in various parts - calling on a more complete severence in communication between the people of [[Panthos\|Panthos]] and [[Pantheon of Anguun\|The Pantheon]], and war in the southern border between [[Eos\|Eos]] and [[Neduyar\|Neduyar]] has erupted between those two nations and the emerging sect. Others have reacted just as extreme, but in the other direction. In [[Tajut\|Tajut]] the [[Yutahirin\|Yutahirin]] (those that purify themselves) have begun seeking to redeem the world in the eyes of the gods. This has resulted in atrocitices to the south in [[Derudara\|Derudara]], the umbral lands, where the Drow and Kenku are already seen as lesser beings, and the practice of shadow magic as evil by the holy in [[Tajut\|Tajut]].

> [!note]- The disappearance of [[Urdua Cardano\|Urdua Cardano]], crown prince of [[Port Mern\|Port Mern]]
> The crown prince of [[Port Mern\|Port Mern]], [[Urdua Cardano\|Urdua Cardano]] son of [[Walua Cardano\|Walua Cardano]], dissappeared from [[Port Mern\|Port Mern]] at the same time a trade envoy from [[Eos\|Eos]] was in the northwestern city of [[Bonnurka\|Bonnurka]]. Suspicion quickly went to the trade envoy from [[Eos\|Eos]], as the negotiations had broken down between the sharing of [[Automatoa\|Automatoa]] crafting secrets with the [[Mechanalocks\|Mechanalocks]], amongst other disputes. Messages and envoys have been traded between the two nations over the past 18 months, however the [[Eos\|Eosans]] claim not to hold [[Urdua Cardano\|Urdua Cardano]], and yet he still remains missing. [[Walua Cardano\|Walua Cardano]] has been overseeing heavy reinforcements of [[Port Mern\|Port Mern]]'s already strong naval force, whilst the [[Eos\|Eosans]] have sent spies and hunters to attempt to find [[Urdua Cardano\|Urdua]] and seek to sure up defensive treaties with their neighbours, should [[Walua Cardano\|Cardano]] seek to invade. 

With the upcoming [[3 star alignment\|3 star alignment]] some of the Gods have been able to choose champions from amongst the fallen (the recently dead).

# Sessions

## S01-Battle with the Sphinx

[[Sol Jaboi\|Sol Jaboi]] and [[Mal Okai\|Mal Okai]] fought to gain entrance to a tunnel into the mountains, defeating a Sphynx. 

## S02-Sands of time

![Panthos western arm trade routes.jpg|400](/img/user/Images/Panthos%20western%20arm%20trade%20routes.jpg)

We are joined by [[Kaelthor the Fuddled\|Kaelthor the Fuddled]] and [[Tutz\|Tutz]], who help get the party through a collapsed sand part of the tunnel, and into section of tunnel where the time is warped. It seems that time speeds up as you approach some threshold. Beyond the threshold are spectral entities, which [[Tutz\|Tutz]] wipes out (partially) with a tidal wave.

## S03-The [[Neralayam\|Neralayam]]

A battle against [[Kuzka\|Kuzka]] spirits, which seem to surround a seated figure / statue. After defeated the statue awakes, revealing itself to be one of the [[Neralayam\|Neralayam]], named [[Taroskian\|Taroskian]], author of the [[Book of Shame\|Book of Shame]]. The [[Neralayam\|Neralayam]] are  large, fine black-scaled humanoids with four arms and large eyes, each holding multiple, shifting irises. They have immense psychic powers that they must constantly hold in check or dominate those around them. [[Taroskian\|Taroskian]] asks of the outside world, but seems only aware of the [[Alhadir\|Alhadir]], the [[Kuzka\|Kuzka]] and potentially others that were brought into the world, with some power. [[Taroskian\|Taroskian]] tells his story of the shame:

> [!tldr] The Shame of the Neralayam
> Long before the current people of [[Anguun\|Anguun]] came the [[Neralayam\|Neralayam]] inhabited the world. They typically appeared as large, fine black-scaled humanoids with four arms and large eyes, each holding multiple, shifting irises. Although master craftsmen of both the mundane, the biological and the arcane they focussed more on matters of the [[the-enduring-dream\|the-enduring-dream]], mastering their minds and psionic powers. They had developed these so intensely that the collective will of the [[Neralayam\|Neralayam]] drove all desire on [[Anguun\|Anguun]], of all beings. As their interests retreated into the dream they created two other peoples to help take care of the world, the [[Kuzka\|Kuzka]] (the Crystaline) and the [[Alhadir\|Alhadir]] (the timeless ones). 
> [[Alhadir\|The Timeless Ones]] were created bereft of a sense of time, but the [[Kuzka\|Kuzka]] were created to be obsessed by it. It was the [[Kuzka\|Kuzka]] that then built [[Inma\|Inma]], an immense arcane machine with the intent of seeing the future. But this obsession drove them, and [[Inma\|Inma]], to seek more data about the world. It leveraged the power of a [[3 star alignment\|3 star alignment]] to rip the worlds asunder, bringing in gods and peoples from many worlds to [[Anguun\|Anguun]]. But those falling into this world struck a note of immense psychic discord with the collective will of the [[Neralayam\|Neralayam]]: [[The Alayam\|The Alayam]]. This resulted in the times of chaos and madness, from which those beings of strongest will helped establish order and free will amongst the new people of [[Anguun\|Anguun]]. 
> The [[Neralayam\|Neralayam]] were horrified at what they had done, and made a decision to retreat from the world. They tried to suppress [[The Alayam\|The Alayam]] and their influence on sentient beings, but not all had the power to keep their will contained. They wrote three tomes to record this, the [[Book of Hubris\|Book of Hubris]] describing why and how they created the [[Kuzka\|Kuzka]] and the [[Alhadir\|Alhadir]], the [[Book of Sunder\|Book of Sunder]] outlining the creation of [[Inma\|Inma]] and the resulting calamity, and the [[Book of Shame\|Book of Shame]] reflecting on what it meant to retreat from the world. A handful stayed on this world, entering themselves into a state of trance. They would appear as statues to any on the outside.  

During the story telling [[Taroskian\|Taroskian]] looses control and casts Feeblemind on [[Kaelthor the Fuddled\|Kaelthor the Fuddled]], so he has Charisma and Intelligence scores of 1, and cannot communicate in any coherent way. 

[[Mal Okai\|Mal Okai]] contacted their patron, [[Malevos\|Malevos]] who appeared through some static, and seemingly some background conversation ([[Taroskian\|Taroskian]] has bestowed all the characters with **Tongues** for the next 48 hours). [[Malevos\|Malevos]] said they may be able to help them escape, but when asked about what they had found (the [[Taroskian\|Taroskian]] and the time-lock) they lied and said it was part of their plan, but nevertheless seemed interested in what they had found. Once the communion was finished [[Mal Okai\|Mal Okai]] had a pearl in their hand - which their patron had warned might be *"painfull"*. [[Taroskian\|Taroskian]] seemed interested in this object, mentioning *"yes it would be painful"* and that *"they may have found the [[Book of Hubris\|Book of Hubris]]"*. This stone is known as a [[Caelis Orb\|Caelis Orb]]. As the connection was released [[Mal Okai\|Mal Okai]] could overhear some talking, and understood the Celestial now, with **Tongues** cast by [[Taroskian\|Taroskian]]: *"Well, looks like the bottom of the barrel came through"*

## S04-Out of the cave, into the light

[[Taroskian\|Taroskian]] heals [[Kaelthor the Fuddled\|Kaelthor the Fuddled]] with assistance. [[Kaelthor the Fuddled\|Kaelthor the Fuddled]] is left with a remnant of [[Taroskian\|Taroskian]] psychic power - a barely contained well of intent and sorrow that he can unleash at a time of his choosing. Mechanically, [[Kaelthor the Fuddled\|Kaelthor the Fuddled]] has four charges to expend of either Hold Monster, Phantasmal Killer, or Feeblemind (DC19). He also gleans the some of the mind of [[Taroskian\|Taroskian]], who is genuinely just barely holding back a potential flood of psychic energy. [[Taroskian\|Taroskian]] further explains that this force, [[The Alayam\|The Alayam]], is what overcame "the refugees", killing them in the hundreds, leaving only some dozen, which seem to be now [[Pantheon of Anguun\|The Pantheon]]. 

The adventurers and [[Taroskian\|Taroskian]] utilise the [[Caelis Orb\|Caelis Orb]] to leave the time-trap, blasting through and appearing above the cavern in the badlands of [[Derudara\|Derudara]], in sight of the ocean. They have a moment to notice a large fleet of ships before [[Rabidus\|Rabidus]] and [[Andreai\|Andreai]], gods of [[Pantheon of Anguun\|The Pantheon]], descend upon them. [[Rabidus\|Rabidus]] immediately crushes [[Taroskian\|Taroskian]] and begins to tear him limb from limb, with the [[Neralayam\|Neralayam]] offering little resistance. A short fight ensues, with the adventurers preventing the gods from destroying [[Taroskian\|Taroskian]] before fighting halts. The gods then offer the heroes a choice: to help the battle against [[Absconditus a Diis\|Absconditus a Diis]] (a war that [[Sol Jaboi\|Sol Jaboi]] was in before his death), or to recruit the fanatical [[Yutahirin\|Yutahirin]] of [[Tajut\|Tajut]] (responsible for [[Mal Okai\|Mal Okai]]'s misfortunes), and gift them 3 scrolls of teleportation, before departing ([[Rabidus\|Rabidus]] quietly notes to [[Andreai\|Andreai]] that they "need to get back soon" before leaving). It is highly unusual for these two gods to be working together. 

The heroes choose neither of those options. The fleet of ships sailing south along the outer western arm of [[Panthos\|Panthos]] is an immense fleet of [[Kuzka\|Kuzka]], with something even more massive swimming below them. [[Taroskian\|Taroskian]] knows this beast, it is a city killer built by [[Inma\|Inma]]. After some discussion the heroes decide to head to the capitol of [[Eos\|Eos]], [[Eotha\|Eotha]], which is the closest they felt safe to teleport within sight of the great mountain [[Exilium Mons\|Exilium Mons]]. It is here, on the storm giant held side, that it is believed [[Orak\|Orak]] the seer, estranged god of the Pantheon, dwells. [[Kaelthor the Fuddled\|Kaelthor the Fuddled]] (I think it was?) knows of someone who had made the pilgramige to visit the Oracle. It seems the gods are blinded to the future, which is why they are recruiting such "misfits", and this is in part due to [[Orak\|Orak]] refusing to look there. [[Taroskian\|Taroskian]] has fond memories of [[Orak\|Orak]], but he instead decides to follow the fleet, on foot, as far as he can. He establishes a telepathic bond between himself and the heroes before they leave - so they can all telepathically communicate for the next 3 days. 

The heroes arrive in [[Eotha\|Eotha]] at the docks. Nearby some [[Automatoa\|Automatoa]] are helping move ships, there is a bustling crowd, and in a nearby public square a rowdy crowd surrounds a makeshift stage in which someone is addressing them. 

## S05-The free minds of [[Eotha\|Eotha]]

> [!quote] A disturbance at the docks
> The [[Ikathys Anchorage\|Ikathys Anchorage]] is a blend of shining light, grandeur and filth. The clear calm waters of the [[Bay of Oramer\|Bay of Oramer]] glisten sharply in the the sunlight, rivalled only by the white stone of the [[Ikathys Anchorage\|Anchorage]]. A near circular wharf of white stone reaches a mile into the bay, with an opening beset by two colossal stone statues, one of [[Andreai\|Andreai]] and the other of [[Potestas\|Potestas]], each over a hundred feet tall and crossing their spears over the gateway into the anchorage. Within the anchorage hundreds of boats move about, the larger docking on the outer ring wharf, the smaller at the inner circular wharf. An isle in the centre of the circular wharf houses a slender watchtower of similar white stone reaching nearly as high as the statues. 
> In the shallows near the waterfront the occasional stone [[Automatoa\|Automatoa]] can be seen stepping into the water and assisting ships docking, and sometimes unloading, and those idle stand at the shore looking to sea, alert for sailors and their signal mirrors flashing to draw their attention. The busy dock workers barely glance at the 12 foot tall arcane constructs, rapidly moving fish, people, goods and messages between the ships and the storehouses, inns, guildhouses, markets and the like on the waterfront. The smell of fish and salt hangs heavy, broken only by the pungent wafts of freshly landing livestock and other sharp, acrid smells of industry. 
> The waterfront is a ring of flat roofed three story buildings, a mixture of stone and some wood. Beyond the city of [[Eotha\|Eotha]] rises steadily into the neighbouring hills, a maze of white stone and coloured cloth decorating buildings and tying them together like a prismatic spider web. Atop each of the some dozens of hills in the city are walled palaces of varying size. Beyond the city the foothills of [[Exilium Mons\|Exilium Mons]] can be seen well into the distance, with the great mountain sloping steadily into the clouds beyond. 
> A crowd has gathered nearby in an open square adjoining the waterfront, maybe a few hundred people. Although predominantly human there is a mix of peoples listening to a simply dressed Tiefling orate, and every now and then there are calls in reply to the questions addressed to the crowd from the orator, louder closer by, but seemingly growing. 

[[Tutz\|Tutz]] gets closer to investigate, walking through the crowd. [[Sol Jaboi\|Sol Jaboi]] talks to the guards to find out that this is [[Mazulodes\|Mazulodes]], a known instigator. They are worried about this escalating into a riot so send for reinforcements. 

> [[Mazulodes\|Mazulodes]]: *What have we done in their (the gods) absence? If you believe the [[Conclavicus\|Conclavicus]] this has been a test, and we have failed. Unrest in our city of light. Open war on our borders. Corruption from within the [[Politkano\|Politkano]], who have stoked war with [[Port Mern\|Mern]] and their [[Mechanalocks\|Mechanalocks]] - said to be on their way here after we kidnapped their heir to the throne. Massacre in [[Derudara\|Derudara]], in the name of our silent ones.
> This is not what **I** have seen.*

[[Tutz\|Tutz]] notices a figure above the stage on the roof, hiding, and looks for a way to get to the roof. A series of people walking past [[Mal Okai\|Mal Okai]] begin speaking to her, goading her to "use every weapon" and to show these people that the gods are still watching. The last words are "whatever you can, do", the words of power of the god [[Malevos\|Malevos]]. 

> *I have seen the unburdening of our lives from the tyranny of oversight, in all it's chaotic splendour. We have only begun surfacing our power of the choice in how we live our lives. Yes, many have chosen poorly, but even [[Tempestus\|Tempestus]] chooses to destroy because she can. *

From the crowd there is a call of  "Like those who took my son!", followed by a scuffle where an elderly clergyman [[Hialgan\|Hialgan]] tries to disagree, and is struck. Through bloodied mouth [[Hialgan\|Hialgan]] says that "the [[Conclavicus\|Conclavicus]] has done all in it's power to help Adrius here, we believe it to be the work of criminals!" The crowd jeers but he continues "test or no test, the gods have given us a way to live. We need not throw it away!"

> [[Mazulodes\|Mazulodes]] continues: *Throw away entirely, no, but who knows what parts have been for our benefit, and what parts for those in power? I say no authority with scrutiny! Their tools of control decay - * he gestures to the stationary [[Automatoa\|Automatoa]] * - and we are discovering new ones!! We are the free minds of Eotha!*

As all look to the stationary [[Automatoa\|Automatoa]] [[Kaelthor the Fuddled\|Kaelthor the Fuddled]]'s eyes linger for a moment longer, and the long stationary machine turns it's head to him. No one else seems to have noticed and [[Kaelthor the Fuddled\|Kaelthor the Fuddled]] approaches the arcane stone robot, casting detect evil and good. Some of the momentum of the crowd ebbs. [[Hialgan\|Hialgan]] calls "do not trade your own doubts for certain destruction of us all [[Mazulodes\|Mazulodes]]!" at which he is struck by the angered father, muttering something about not taking another child, and [[Hialgan\|Hialgan]] falls dead. At this time [[Tutz\|Tutz]] gets to the roof but is noticed by the assassin there. The assassin attacks and uses a smoke bomb to hide and descend down the front of the building towards the crowd, but [[Tutz\|Tutz]] turns a poisoned bolt back on the Assassin, blinks behind him, then wall walks after him, and grapples them as they fall. 

The riot has begun, [[Sol Jaboi\|Sol Jaboi]] heads in fits swinging to help, followed reluctantly by the guards. [[Kaelthor the Fuddled\|Kaelthor the Fuddled]] detects the holy energy reigniting in the [[Automatoa\|Automatoa]], which immediately offers its services to him. [[Mal Okai\|Mal Okai]] and [[Tutz\|Tutz]] subdue and interrogate the assassin whilst [[Kaelthor the Fuddled\|Kaelthor the Fuddled]], the [[Automatoa\|Automatoa]] and [[Sol Jaboi\|Sol Jaboi]] subdue the crowd, with a mixture of concern for and disregard of life. [[Kaelthor the Fuddled\|Kaelthor the Fuddled]] notices holy energy flooding into the body of [[Hialgan\|Hialgan]], and that a similar colour embraces his own essence, whilst a disturbing black and red fiendish energy is bound to [[Sol Jaboi\|Sol Jaboi]].

The assassin reveals that it has been paid by the [[Conclavicus\|Conclavicus]] to eliminate [[Mazulodes\|Mazulodes]] the dissenter. [[Hialgan\|Hialgan]] arises a new one of the chosen, and offers to guide the heroes on the pilgrimage. They prepare minimally and and teleport somewhere near the gate to the giants kingdom and the beginning of the trail - but not quite the right spot. After some initial scouting the heroes are on the correct trail, they believe, towards [[Orak\|Orak]].

## S06 -[[Orak\|Orak]], the seer who turned away
