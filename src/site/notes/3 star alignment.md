Every so often the 3 key celestial bodies about [[Anguun\|Anguun]] align, allowing enhanced access to the powers from the three planets: [[Siamaidar\|Siamaidar]], [[Darakizidar\|Darakizidar]], [[Woevrundar\|Woevrundar]]. This typically occurs every 60 years or so, but can be as frequent as 23 years or over 200 between each occurrence.
