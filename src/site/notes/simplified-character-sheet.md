Need to do properly! :) 
The gist of it is that lots of words and details can be streamlined if you add Proficiency Bonus (PB) and Ability modifiers one at a time. So instead of needing somewhere on the character sheet to have the +6 to hit with a longsword, you would roll a d20 then add the ability modifier (+4 for STR, say) and then add the PB (+2) because / if the character is proficient in the weapon. Same for saving throws

# Abilities - include modifiers only

STR +4
DEX +3
CON +2
INT +1 
WIS +0
CHA -1

# Proficiencies

Proficiency Bonus (PB): +2

## Saving throws:
e.g. STR, CON

## Weapons and Armor
e.g. Martial weapons, all armour and shields

## Tools and Instruments
e.g. Flute, Woodcarvers tools

## Skills

e.g. Athletics, Stealth, Perception

# Background

Include background, languages (if being used), people they know (ie. bonds), etc. 

# Features, traits, spells

This part varies so much for class - hard to judge exactly what is needed. 

# Actions

Ideally this is done using cards - so having Action, Bonus Action, and Reaction cards of what a character can do. They can then spend one of each for each round of combat.
