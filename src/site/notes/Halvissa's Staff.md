A powerful, but cursed Staff of the Magi. 

It can be identified with a *DC15 History / Arcana* check, and the higher the roll the more is known of it's past:

> [!info] The legend of Halvissa's Staff
> *DC18 History / Arcana:*
> [[Halvissa\|Halvissa]] was a powerful Mage in the early days of the [[Ovrunium Order\|Ovrunium Order]], and hero of the [[War of Makersin\|War of Makersin]]. The staff was already a powerful artefact, discovered by the order and handed down to high ranking mages. Each mage was warned to not over-use the staff, but Halvissa did not heed the warnings. After laying waste to the enemy in the [[Battle of Port Mern\|Battle of Port Mern]] he returned...changed. 
> *DC 22 History / Arcana*
> He became obsessed with finding the 'lost spell' residing within the staff. He began to mistrust those around him. Some old friends disappeared, not always on their own terms. Halvissa was always 'close' to finding it, said it was a 'world-changing' magic. He continued to rise in power, and then, just disappeared, leaving the staff behind. The staff continues to be handed down within the [[Ovrunium Order\|Order]], but is seldom used by the Mages, and only under dire circumstances.
> *DC 25 History / Arcana*
> It is rumoured that the staff is possessed by mages past, or perhaps it possesses mages that once used the staff. 300 years after the [[War of Makersin\|War of Makersin]] a bearer of the staff, [[Olgunhayman\|Olgunhayman]], began secretly using the staff in his research, talking to it, asking it questions about past events. He wrote extensive notes on the historical events from the point of view of "Gulfazar" - but no one has any record of this person in any other text. 
> *DC 30 History / Arcana*
> There was a curious side note in [[Olgunhayman\|Olgunhayman]]'s work, towards the end of his life. It seemed to refer to the first bearer of the staff, [[Faylinfar\|Faylinfar]]. This name is also used in an older fable, [[Faylinfar and Morludun\|Faylinfar and Morludun]], where the powerful witch Faylinfar re-writes history so that her lover, [[Morludun\|Morludun]], can live. However she is haunted by both worlds, the one she experienced and the one she created, forever not knowing which is real. 

Additionally, a rumour is known:

| d8  | -   |
| --- | --- |
| 1   | The staff is possessed by long dead mages. |
| 2   | The bearer can change their own fate using the staff, and of those around them, if they act quickly. |
| 3   | The staff feeds off the bearers memories. |
| 4   | The staff holds a great magical secret within it. |
| 5   | The staff grants the bearer the ability to see through time, into past and future. |
| 6   | The staff is not an arcane artefact, but a conduit to the gods of fate. |
| 7 | The staff is powerful, but draws essence from the bearer, until they are completely reliant on the staff for their arcane power |
| 8 | The staff can grant wishes, but only after consuming the soul of an ally |
The staff is currently possessed by [[NPCs/Marcus Edge\|Marcus Edge]], who has never attuned it because he believes the rumour that it draws arcane power from the bearer. 

# Game mechanics

It operates as a https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4767-staff-of-the-magi, but with the following changes:

## Sentience: "Gulfazar"

There is a sentience within the staff, referring to itself as "Gulfazar", a merged entity of those that have been imprisoned by the staff. "Gulfazar" means "stew / casserole" in an old dialect, which might be known on a DC25 History check. When attuned 'they' will introduce themselves to the **Grand Mage** who now bares the staff. It knows things (Acrana + 13, History +10) - the user can ask the staff questions at will once they reach the 'familiarity' stage (with possible consequences, see below)

## Descent into madness

Using the staff incurs a chance of progressive madness, as the will of the staff becomes more dominant. Upon attuning the staff, the wielder is at Stage 0. Depending on how heavily the staff has been used the wielder runs a risk of descending into madness. The staff has 50 charges, and recharges `4d6+2` charges at dawn. If the staff has less than 30 charges when recharging, the user must make a DC 8 + the current stage of madness num er Wisdom save or increase their stage by 1, incurring all penalties. If the staff has fewer than 10 charges when recharging the DC is 12 + the current stage number. If the staff is reduced to 0 charges at any point an immediate save is made at of DC 15 + the current stage number.

All effects, and benefits, are cumulative.

###  Stage 0 - Attunement
The user has attuned the staff. It operates as a normal Staff of the Magi, and the bearer can un-attune the staff with no penalty. 

The staff can also be used for understanding the intent of other beings, it's personality arising through a feeling of right and wrong. At the cost of one charge, it can make an Insight check at +13. 

### Stage 1 - Familiarity
The bearer can now sense magical essence - effectively casting **Detect Magic** as a bonus action, instead of an action. They are also, however, plagued by the feeling they have lost something dear to them, and are often distracted, suffering **disadvantage** on **Intelligence checks**.

They can also now converse with the staff and ask the staff questions, 1 charge for each question. The staff has Arcana +13 and History +10.

The user can only un-attune the staff on a successful DC17 charisma save. A failed save incurs `8d8` psychic damage. A remove curse spell gives advantage on the save.

### Stage 2 - Friendship
The bearer can now see the unseen - they can cast **Detect Invisibility** at will, as a bonus action. They also, however, suffer from vivid hallucinations and incur **disadvantage** on **Dexterity Saving Throws**. Each time they use **Detect Invisibility** or **Detect Magic** roll `1d8`, on a 1 they see something that isn't actually there. Their paranoia also imposes **disadvantage** on **Persuasion** checks.

The user can only un-attune the staff with a remove curse spell and on success of a DC17 charisma save. It can be attempted without a remove curse spell, but the DC is now 24. More powerful magic can give advantage to the save. Failure incurs `10d10` points of psychic damage.

### Stage 3 - Kin
The bearer can now **Scry** at will, however they have a 1 in 6 chance of observing a hallucination each time they use this ability. Their paranoia deepens - imposing **disadvantage** on **Wisdom checks**. Each `1d10` days they must make a Wisdom saving throw against DC13. On a failed save they are convinced that one of their allies (randomly chosen) is an enemy. Every round they are in this allies presence they must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC13) or attack them with full force. A successful still incurs `2d6` Psychic damage. If they destroy this new "enemy", or make a successful save, roll `1d10` again to see how many days until they make a new save, for a newly perceived "enemy" to be discovered.

The user can only un-attune the staff with a remove curse spell and on success of a DC24 charisma save. More powerful magic can give advantage to the save. Failure incurs `12d12` points of psychic damage.

### Stage 4 - Completeness
The paranoia is so extreme that the saving throws (from Stage 3) are now DC18, and the number of days between saves is `1d6`.

Only death can seperate the user and the staff. 

## Imprisonment

If the retributive strike feature is used roll 1d6. A roll of 1 - 3 indicates that the user becomes imprisoned within the staff, their personality merging with those already in there.
