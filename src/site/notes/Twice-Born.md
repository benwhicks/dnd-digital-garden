Sometimes [[Morsos\|Morsos]] will bring to the attention of a god someone who has died in a fashion they would greatly approve of. The god then gives a bit of themselves to that being, bringing them back with great powers (20th level). This is seldom done as the gift must be given freely and the power only returns with the death of the mortal. These people are known as the [[Twice-Born\|Twice-Born]] (Religion DC12).

This is seldom done (Religion DC15), as when the god gives up part of their immortal soul for this they become mortal - that is until the Twice-Born dies again (Religion DC19).
