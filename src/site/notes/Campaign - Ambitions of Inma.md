They also encounter [[Kelf\|Kelf]], a soldier of [[Igbele\|Igbele]], whom [[Campaigns/FTM/Felloak\|Felloak]] imbues with some power from his god. Wandering into [[Igbele\|Igbele]], [[Campaigns/FTM/Majerious\|Majerious]] becomes entangled with a criminal gang known as [[The Vase\|The Vase]].

### 3141 Cq, early Winter, [[Pra-Jollun Observatory\|The Observatory]]

With the aid of [[NPCs/Marcus Edge\|Marcus Edge]] and [[Golgora Inoroka\|Golgora Inoroka]] the adventurers follow the two remaining Kuzka ambassadors into their lens chamber of the [[Pra-Jollun Observatory\|Pra-Jollun Observatory]]. A battle ensues with [[Golgora Inoroka\|Golgora]] barely surviving, and the only remains of the two Kuzka being their magical head medallions. These are [[Medallions of Sublime Submission\|Medallions of Sublime Submission]]

### Key Learnings

### 3141 Cq, Winter, [[Pra-Jollun Observatory\|The Observatory]] Felloak & Tjara

[[Campaigns/FTM/Felloak\|Felloak]] spends the weeks 'researching' with acolyte [[Oroka Yu\|Oroka Yu]] around his powers and abilities. They become close. Felloak uncovers how to sense trees that can take him to his pocket world 'the Grove' where he is powerful. 

[[Campaigns/FTM/Tjara\|Tjara]] works with [[NPCs/Marcus Edge\|Marcus Edge]] translating the fragments of the [[Book of Sunder\|Book of Sunder]]. Tjara is slightly quicker at the translation than Marcus, remaining one step ahead. Tjara shows Marcus the entire book. Marcus becomes less distracted and more interested in the translation when it is suddenly apparent that some of it relates to what was being built at the Observatory. Using the schematic they begin to make much more progress with the lenses (with the assistance of Majerious). 

### Key Learnings

- [[Campaigns/FTM/Felloak\|Felloak]] learns how to find a tree that can travel to 'the Grove' world.
- [[Campaigns/FTM/Tjara\|Tjara]] learns the book is: written by a people possibly older than the [[Kuzka\|Kuzka]], describes some schematics for the [[Pra-Jollun Observatory\|Observatory]], ...

### 3141 Cq, Mn 7, Dy 11 to Mn 8, Dy 25: Majerious

[[NPCs/Marcus Edge\|Marcus Edge]] is promised a Staff of the Magi in exchange for Majerious' help and discretion. Majerious is providing power to the station through his own innate power, delving into the power of the cognitive plane. [[Campaigns/FTM/Majerious\|Majerious]] learns that [[NPCs/Marcus Edge\|Marcus]] is planning something for in 6 weeks, but arises his suspicion about the questions. 

Majerious then checks the library for more information around the feeling he gets that some 'entity' has an echo residing within the observatory network - but there is no record of such. He dives deeper and understands the echo he is experiencing is from [[Inma\|Inma]], lingering in the network of the Observatory. The essence is not malevolent, nor sentient, but some echo of what was there that is fading. It seems to have a strong desire for *order* and *predictability*. 

Leading into tonights dinner, there is a tension between Majerious and Marcus, as Marcus begins to suspect that Majerious is not telling him all about 

### Key Learnings

- Description of any important information that the party learned.
- Staff of the Magi promised to Majerious.

### 3141 Cq, mid-winter, at [[The Observatory\|The Observatory]]

[[Campaigns/FTM/Felloak\|Felloak]] contacts [[Marius Edge\|Marius Edge]] to ask if he would be concerned about [[NPCs/Marcus Edge\|Marcus Edge]] building a conduit to another entity. He did not seem too concerned. 
At a group dinner it is apparent that [[NPCs/Marcus Edge\|Marcus]] and [[Golgora Inoroka\|Golgora Inoroka]] are working closely together on the lower levels of the device, and that [[Winstra Munz\|Winstra Munz]] does not approve. 
{ #688797}


Marcus has offered (and shown) Majerious a magical staff. From the description [[Campaigns/FTM/Tjara\|Tjara]] knew the following:

> [!info] The legend of Halvissa's Staff
> *DC18 History / Arcana:*
> [[Halvissa\|Halvissa]] was a powerful Mage in the early days of the [[Ovrunium Order\|Ovrunium Order]], and hero of the [[War of Makersin\|War of Makersin]]. The staff was already a powerful artefact, discovered by the order and handed down to high ranking mages. Each mage was warned to not over-use the staff, but Halvissa did not heed the warnings. After laying waste to the enemy in the [[Battle of Port Mern\|Battle of Port Mern]] he returned...changed. 
> *DC 22 History / Arcana*
> He became obsessed with finding the 'lost spell' residing within the staff. He began to mistrust those around him. Some old friends disappeared, not always on their own terms. Halvissa was always 'close' to finding it, said it was a 'world-changing' magic. He continued to rise in power, and then, just disappeared, leaving the staff behind. The staff continues to be handed down within the [[Ovrunium Order\|Order]], but is seldom used by the Mages, and only under dire circumstances.
> *DC 25 History / Arcana*
> It is rumoured that the staff is possessed by mages past, or perhaps it possesses mages that once used the staff. 300 years after the [[War of Makersin\|War of Makersin]] a bearer of the staff, [[Olgunhayman\|Olgunhayman]], began secretly using the staff in his research, talking to it, asking it questions about past events. He wrote extensive notes on the historical events from the point of view of "Gulfazar" - but no one has any record of this person in any other text. 
> *DC 30 History / Arcana* - not reached. It's probably fine though. 

After some support for the project [[NPCs/Marcus Edge\|Marcus Edge]] offers Majerious the staff, with his promise that in two weeks he will offer his full support. Majerious is now at "Stage 1 - Friendship" in his enhanced attunement of the staff.

[[Campaigns/FTM/Tjara\|Tjara]] fully decodes the remainder of the [[Book of Sunder\|Book of Sunder]], which does not paint a pretty picture. It does contain some great stories though, and any Bard using it to tell a story gains advantage on **Performance** checks. 

[[Campaigns/FTM/Felloak\|Felloak]] discovers [[Molo\|Molo]] lurking around the Observatory still. He befriends her with food and learns that she has been 'skipping through time' and regularly checking in on the goings on in the Observatory, but was prevented from travelling until recently. She talks of the [[Kuzka\|Kuzka]] as though what they worked on messed up the world, badly. She talks of her "masters" and [[Campaigns/FTM/Felloak\|Felloak]]'s deity, and warns him against looking into the future. 

The adventures have learned that the wizards are preparing for an alignment of the three great wandering stars (planets) due in one weeks time: [[Darakizidar\|Darakizidar]], [[Siamaidar\|Siamaidar]] and [[Woevrundar\|Woevrundar]]. There is one week until the alignment, and two days until the monks visit the Observatory for their usual monthly update. 

### Key Learnings

-  [[Halvissa's Staff\|Halvissa's Staff]] is intereting

## 2024-03-05

### 3141 Cq, mid-winter, [[Pra-Jollun Observatory\|The Observatory]]

[[Campaigns/FTM/Tjara\|Tjara]] catches [[Winstra Munz\|Winstra Munz]] alone to talk about the current plans of [[NPCs/Marcus Edge\|Marcus Edge]] 
She asks as for us to confirm whether [[Oroka Yu\|Oroka Yu]] will side with Marcus or her.

[[Campaigns/FTM/Felloak\|Felloak]] talks with [[Oroka Yu\|Oroka Yu]], with her indicating she thinks he should just talk to Marcus but doesn't really indicates that she would choose a side clearly. She thinks Marcus is nicer than Winstra though.

[[Campaigns/FTM/Tjara\|Tjara]] went to spy on Marcus' conversation.

> [!quote] **Overheard on Marcus' conversation**
> - The staff was necessary, working on something much greater than your plans for invasion 
> - Understand your concerns, but we'll still meet your requirements but just have additional work, longer work
> - We'll let you know if we have any concerns about our source
> - I can only assure you so many times, your needs will be met, and the alignment will provide you with the proper guidance, you have my word
> - *after hanging up* Imbecile.. petty moron

[[Campaigns/FTM/Felloak\|Felloak]] casts Commune to try and work out some more based on the overheard conversation..
- Marcus is not conspiring with the [[Kuzka\|Kuzka]]
- Marcus was talking with someone from the [[Cerescribes\|Cerescribes]]
- Enabling the device might result in chaos or order but [[Campaigns/FTM/Felloak\|Felloak]] should choose another way.

[[Campaigns/FTM/Majerious\|Majerious]] uses the staff to try and figure out the schematics components in the [[Book of Sunder\|Book of Sunder]]. He determines some of the functions of the controls, but wasn't able to work out much more.

[[Campaigns/FTM/Tjara\|Tjara]] informs [[Winstra Munz\|Winstra Munz]]. She believes Osoka will side with Marcus based on her response to Felloak. She is unsure as to whether [[Port Mern\|Port Mern]] would be invading. Otherwise was unsure as to Marcus true intent.

[[Campaigns/FTM/Majerious\|Majerious]] goes to help Marcus with the observatory controls.

[[Campaigns/FTM/Majerious\|Majerious]] got shafted into going next level on the crystal palace. Marcus and his shiny neck side-kick ([[Golgora Inoroka\|Golgora Inoroka]]) conspire to do something but [[Campaigns/FTM/Majerious\|Majerious]] doesn't hear what that is.

The crystal palace flashes and Tjara notices, tells Winstra who runs for it - dives down into the chamber and folds herself some wings. Tjara keeps running.

Felloak get set upon while chilling in is room by a huge blobby tentacle floating blob. It has eyes on it's tenacles and turned Felloak to stone. Molok turn up just as that happens.

### 3141 Cq, mid-winter, 3 nights before alignment. Battle at [[Pra-Jollun Observatory\|The Observatory]]

[[Campaigns/FTM/Felloak\|Felloak]], [[Campaigns/FTM/Majerious\|Majerious]], [[Campaigns/FTM/Tjara\|Tjara]]Running down the stairs, Tjara takes off after Winstra as she flies to the bottom of this chamber. The light in the crystal seems to be fading a little. Molo intercepts Tjara and says that "Felloak is somewhere safe. A quiet moon. View of Darakizidar." Tjara decides that is good enough and keeps heading down the stairs, [[Molo\|Molo]] in tow.

Upon reaching the bottom they discover a rift having appeared at the floor of this tower. Molo immediately starts sewing it up, stating that its the realm of the dragons.

Meanwhile, Majerious is still trapped in the mechanism and struggles to break free. Golgora is scared of the implications of what happened when Majerious pushed his power into the device, but Marcus is convinced that Majerious should proceed, maybe even before the coming convergence in the heavens. As he struggles to break free, a Beholder comes into the room and immediately starts attacking Golgora.

Back at the rift, a HUGE green dragon claw appears in the rift followed by the blow of the dragon's breath which the party in the room do their best to avoid. Tjara casts Wall of Force around the portal in the other plane, pushing the dragon out and preventing access from the other side. Molo, Tjara and Winstra seal the rift.. eventually..

In the control room, the Beholder starts shooting rays at all of the people in the room. Golgora is charmed after getting damaged. Marcus shouts to ignore the beast, but then proceeds to try and hide. Majerious finally breaks free from the controls and the unloads lightning after lightning into the Beholder until it turns its anti-magic eye on to him, holding off the barrage. 

They finally dispatch the creature, but not until it Beholder kills Marcus with a series of Death Rays. The remaining wizards and team then go and close the other rifts, discovering the acoloytes stunned in front of one. They seem to be going through some kind of withdrawal. 

The rifts were to: 
The dragon home??
A dark dank cave
A shiny palace

### 3141 Cq, mid-winter, 2 nights before alignment, [[Pra-Jollun Observatory\|The Observatory]]

[[Campaigns/FTM/Felloak\|Felloak]], [[Campaigns/FTM/Majerious\|Majerious]], [[Campaigns/FTM/Tjara\|Tjara]]Wynstra is leading the way to Marcus Edge's office - wants to see his notes
She's concerned about his connection to the [[Cerescribes\|Cerescribes]]
The Kuska would've passed through [[Port Mern\|Port Mern]]
Marcus and Golgorra were getting closer and closer
Wynstra feels like she neglected the people around her while she studied ancient texts

Tjara finds a book. Refers to Someone with the initials JP. talk of using the machine to damage the tether to further aid in the conquest. Marcus is not so interested in that, but is interested in unlocking something that's locked away in Prusah Sriku 
The tether is probably the [[Tether of Parmosius\|Tether of Parmosius]], near [[Port Mern\|Port Mern]], Kingdom called [[Panthos\|Panthos]] "Kingdom of the Gods", Port Mern's main trading partner, where lies the "Tether of Gods".
Marcus had mentioned rumours of the tether being damaged 40 years ago in the last alignment. The stone one - Felloak, has the healing magic -- this hasn't been seen around these parts since about 40 years ago. [[Winstra Munz\|Winstra Munz]] suspects that someone else has been coding the book, or at least calling the shots. 
Wynstra also finds a map - the map of the [[Kenem Path\|Kenem Path]]

![[map.Kenem_Path.jpg\|450]]

[[Halvissa's Staff\|Halvissa's Staff]] keeps calling to Majerious to go to the control room and either merge or control the controls.

The monks agree to help cleanse the Wizards and unfreeze Felloak. Some lights seem to be indicating that Wynstra isn't confident that she can sort out the situation. 
Four elemental types like Majerious are waiting at the gates of the Monastery 

Someone's been in the control room. They left a magical residue in runes - effectively flipping switches. 

Tjara and Maj find Golgorra in the control room. Convince him to come clean to Wynstra. He tells Wynstra that Marcus and Janeck were doing things - Marcus thought there was something better to do with the alignment than political manoeuvring or attacking the gods. Marcus had said there was a scroll somewhere to become greater than him, that if we could focus the energy of the observatory into someone we would gain great insight. They tried it on Golgorra, but it didn't quite work. the idea of using Maj was getting it must closer. Janeck still wanted to use a mesh to attack the tether, but Marcus disagreed. Golgorra gets commanded by a presence in his mind from time to time - since he tried to focus the observatory. The presence is not Inma, not sure what it wants, but it wants everything to be in keeping with the prophesy, wants everything in order. Golgorra doesn't think that the text is in the library. The rift to the sweet Persian set-up had something to do with the presence. By playing with different runes on different tablets they could open different rifts to different places, but Golgorra doesn't understand exactly what Marcus had figured out. 

We remove the influence of the entity using the staff - Golgorra is healed. Says that the entity was reaching out to [[Inma\|Inma]]. Like Inma but not. Upon revision of evidence at hand - we discover that Inma was designed as a foreteller of the future. 

Felloak has been un-petrified. He has the ability to resist the healing to preserve his magic blindness, or to have it healed - to be continued in our next instalment!

## 2024-07-11

### Night before the alignment, [[Pra-Jollun Observatory\|The Observatory]]

[[Campaigns/FTM/Tjara\|Tjara]] is talking to Janek through one of the crazy stones
Janek let's on that the Tether *is* the target 

Talking through the Square speaking stone... Elamine Luralan from Igbele turns out to be on the other end

Molo warns not to look into the future because the FutureBinder is a bad dude who Molo's people have trifled with, and come off second-best *Beware the FutureBinder, I was there to evade him*

We dislocate the crystal at the top of the control room in the observatory with the wizards then head back across to the monastery. The villagers have all gone home. We go to talk to the Genasi

The Genasi have grown from 2 to 5... Maj gets the sense this is all of them. They are talking about how we have cut the head off one of our problems, but not the others. they still want Maj to plant the seed. They are talking of my mother Djinn being angry and that she is coming soon. Tjara, and Felloak, note that they are looking at a coming storm when they talk about the mother Djinn coming. They want Maj to come down and talk, but none of us trust each other.

We went down to talk to them but they were non-committal.

Panthos is an island that is close to the gods' holy land. Tjara was talking to someone there. Folks have been using this with the tower and the alignment to do something.

Chatted to Golgorra... there's a plan to break the tether, then Panthos would be under attack. The wizard orders were getting together to attack while the gods were out of rotation

Wynstra is keen to plant the seed some creature began to materialise but then I outrolled it with my roll up my sleeve

## 2024-08-15

Golden Rod creature was materialising but [[Campaigns/FTM/Majerious\|Majerious]] high roll and seed growing quickly led to creature in the middle collapsing falling in a heap with the long arm-like things breaking in two.

The plant looks "every definition" of out of control. To [[Campaigns/FTM/Felloak\|Felloak]] this appears to be unnatural. It doesn't have the patterns that everything else has had in recent days... It is "stochastic".

The creature seems to be made of energy. It is drawing in power and filling out but still struggling. Four arms. Would be like a [[Kuzka\|Kuzka]] but is too tall (8 foot), thin, and has a head that arcs forward at the top. 

Creature read [[Campaigns/FTM/Majerious\|Majerious]]' mind. Smashed creature, it smashed us. it disappeared, with animated cloak in tow. [[Molo\|Molo]] disappeared after it. [[Winstra Munz\|Winstra Munz]] fled. 

[[Campaigns/FTM/Felloak\|Felloak]] axed the vine, which changed it to be more natural. [[Campaigns/FTM/Felloak\|Felloak]] encircled the vine with a spinning blades ring wall. It was contained, at least for the 10 minutes that the blade ward will last, however the more natural 'tree-like' growth sprouting from [[Campaigns/FTM/Felloak\|Felloak]]'s pruning seems to be combating the elemental seed growth. 

No news yet on the storm outside, or the other remaining wizards. 


## 2024-10-12

[[Campaigns/FTM/Majerious\|Majerious]] and [[Campaigns/FTM/Tjara\|Tjara]] dimension into another chamber to chase the bad guy. [[Molo\|Molo]] appears in a rage to help. Maj does some hectic damage and kills the guy. Molo takes glee and collects her quarry -  a gem from the remnants.
The gem is "one of three" says [[Molo\|Molo]] amongst some other stuff about [[Inma\|Inma]] the [[Kuzka\|Kuzka]]. There is another *race* like the Kuzka, perhaps also another 1/3 of something something. 
[[Campaigns/FTM/Felloak\|Felloak]] axed the seed, and made it good. His tree god took over the seed and grew a big tree.
The gem is a phylactery and can revive the living being back to life within 10 days unless it is destroyed, or remove curse. Tjara dispelled it.
Winstra is thinking about heading to [[Port Mern\|Port Mern]].
The tree is destroying the facility.
Winstra says a heap of her magic has been unlocked. Shows off that dimensions can be opened and shut. The wizards are busy stuffing the library into what look like bags of holding. [[Molo\|Molo]] discovers that the storm outside is blocking dimensional travel though, at least temporarily. 
Tree god says that the [[Squatters\|Squatters]] will try to banish the tree god. Felloak is tasked to protect the tree from them. He accepts a shield from it, repurposed from his axe.
The groups is split up and spills out of the crumbling facility into the storm.
[[Campaigns/FTM/Majerious\|Majerious]]' air spirit / storm asks him to come home, and is not taking kindly to his refusal. 

Next initiative: air spirits, wizards, felloak, majarious, tjara.

## 2024-11-21

Battle!

Heroes prevail. Immense tree has been birthed from the top of the mountain, destroying [[Pra-Jollun Observatory\|The Observatory]]. This is the living heart of [[Campaigns/FTM/Felloak\|Felloak]]'s god in this world. 

Where to next?
