> [!info] Darakizidar
> A wander of the night, the fire-orange star Darakizidar is one of the three most important stars in the sky. An omen of power, for both good and ill, it is said that some born under it's influence are forever cursed. Regarded with suspicion by most organised religions, but often revered by the Fey and more old god worshippers. Those of the Arcane arts see it as a source of power.

Some born under it's zenith become [[Darakomere\|Darakomere]] - Dragonborn. 

The other wandering stars (planetary gas giants - *History / Arcana DC 18*) are [[Siamaidar\|Siamaidar]] and [[Woevrundar\|Woevrundar]].

> [!warning]- Game notes
> This is one of the three gas giants in the solar system, alongside [[Siamaidar\|Siamaidar]] and [[Woevrundar\|Woevrundar]]. This is the original home of the Dragons, the [[Rohak horde\|Rohak horde]] (*History DC 21*), living in immense floating vegetation / structures that float in the various layers of the gas giant.
