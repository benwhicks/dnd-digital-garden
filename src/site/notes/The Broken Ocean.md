East of the lands of the [[Simain\|Simain]], south east of [[The Shogonate\|The Shogonate]], lies a collapsed part of the world of [[Anguun\|Anguun]] that boats simply do not return from. Deep fog and clouds are the first sign, and some have sailed a little ways into them, noting their intense moisture and buffeting winds. It's boundary is easily seen from afar - a wall of dense clouds from sea to sky, punctuated by occasional yellow lightning. This is known as the Storm Wall.

> We came close once, when pressed by storms and the attention of the water shogun's ships. You could taste the difference in the air - sweet and metallic - even as the storm buffeted our sails. Although the storm had blown us towards the denser mist it was met with another force - somewhere between a stiff breeze and intense pressure. We saw one of the shogun's craft disappear - like it was just swallowed by the ocean, or some creature, we could not see. The Olukala narrowly missed a sharp finger of rock, rising from the depths, as the currents seemed to rip around it. We could see more of these rising in the mist in the east, and the water becoming turbulent - frothing like the mouth of [[Rabidus\|Rabidus]] himself. 
> I have faced down some of the great beasts of the sea, dragons of the depths, but what lay beyond those jagged teeth I do not wish to seek. Our Windlock used every last breath of his power to get us out of there. 

> [!quote] Tarum Tarada - Simian Bard of the [[Alder Sea\|Alder Sea]]
> It is said that the great sky-caption Ozofeo traversed the storm wall, well that is at least what she claimed. No-one believed her. Tales of a cavern deeper than mountains, walls of water at it's sides, glowing stones below that hid from the airship when it passed over. A realm hidden from the stars, beneath a cover of mist that warped the colours of the sun into a shifting prism of light. An archipelago below the sea, of rocky outcrops with fungi the size of great oaks. Mischievous sprites with powerful magic that knew arcane secrets long forgotten, bending the world to their will. 
> It is said that she tricked one into helping her escape, but others have noted that none of her crew returned, and speculate on what trade may have happened. We [[Simain\|Simain]]'s do like [[the trader's dance\|the trader's dance]]. No matter what you believe, the fact remain's that Ozofeo took her airship further east than any have been before, and then returned absent a single other crew member. Some say at night you might catch her in her grotto, holding something small, and glowing, in her hands, with tears in her eyes.  

# DM notes

The Broken Ocean is an immense island sized chasm in the ocean. The ocean flows in as waterfalls around, only to be met by some of the latent forces that created the chasm. The water is largely vapourised, and pushed back into the sky. Some falls around the rim and settles into the ocean below the ocean. Several islands are scattered below, but the sky above is often blocked by mist and the light is distorted in strange ways.
