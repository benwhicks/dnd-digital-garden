## Session Overview 
 
### Setting
Characters began in the mountain village of [[Ackrule\|Ackrule]] in the kingdom of [[Urlhanlan\|Urlhanlan]]. The village is in the south east of the realm, in the shadow of the snow capped peak of [[Mount Tomock\|Mount Tomock]] and at the source of the [[Esparan River\|Esparan River]].  The river flows to the north west through the [[Madalan Fields\|Madalan Fields]] (fertile lands growing rice, maize and tea), surrounded by the [[Tharaz-Mir Jungle\|Tharaz-Mir Jungle]], where the Tabaxi [[Felinika\|Felinika]] live, and on to the coastal city of [[Separne\|Separne]]. The [[Darakomere\|Darakomere]] (Dragonborn) are unusually common in [[Urlhanlan\|Ularan]], human babies born cursed under the [[Darakizidar\|Darakizidar]]. They are common enough that elder Dragonborn sometimes adopt young babies and raise them. Both the [[Felinka\|Felinka]] and [[Darakomere\|Darakomere]] are regarded with suspicion by the human population, but largely tolerated in the major cities.  More reviled by the general population are the [[Urlhanlan#Kobolds\|Kobolds]] and [[Urlhanlan#Bugbears\|Bugbears]] that inhabit the mountains that lie along the eastern border of [[Urlhanlan\|Ularan]]. 

### The first job

In the market place in [[Ackrule\|Ackrule]] [[Campaigns/LilCuz/Kuzu\|Kuzu]] has been working as security for the local stalls (at the behest of [[Parathur\|Parathur]] the head merchant - not mentioned in the game). He spots [[Campaigns/LilCuz/Saya\|Saya]] attempting to steal a jewelled dagger from a stall, and chases her down a dead end ally. They battle, and are joined in combat by [[Campaigns/LilCuz/Telehatne\|Telehatne]], who thinks that [[Campaigns/LilCuz/Saya\|Saya]] has used dark magic to kill a protector of the town (she had just put him to sleep). 

Watching this was captain of the guard, [[NPCs/Orlu\|Orlu]]. Orlu is impressed and employs them, for 200 gp each, to check to see if the [[Tarack mine\|Tarack mine]] is safe, and not haunted by some demon as reported by the miners who have fled the mines. Players agree and set off after a long rest.

Weather is difficult, and players survive a rock slide due to the heavy rain and wind. They are currently looking for shelter for the night. The [[Tarack mine\|Tarack mine]] is still a half days walk away as night begins to fall.

## Session Overview 
 
### Into the mine

They arrive at the [[Tarack mine\|Tarack mine]], which is abandoned. The entrance is a make shift lift straight into the ground. After descending they battle a Black Pudding, which oozes from the ceiling. They defeat it, but take heavy damage and [[Campaigns/LilCuz/Saya\|Saya]] is knocked unconscious briefly.

## Session Overview

### The infected tree
The adventurers delve deeper into the mine, after a long rest. In there they find twisted, black, animated roots from the ceiling. They have trapped the fairy [[Campaigns/LilCuz/Dark Flitter\|Dark Flitter]], whom [[Campaigns/LilCuz/Kuzu\|Kuzu]] rescues. She tells them of the three infestations of the mine that she has seen: the infected tree, the black ooze, and the large insect creatures. [[Campaigns/LilCuz/Dark Flitter\|Dark Flitter]] had journeyed there from her woods because the tree was in distress, but had not expected the other monsters. 

They return to the surface at night, and find the (above ground) and battle the infestation. We end as the blackened and tainted vine creature is thrown from the mountain.
