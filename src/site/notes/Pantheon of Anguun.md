# Interactions with mortals

## Signs


## Vessels

Gods communicate with people through Vessels - talking through another person to them. The vessel is unaware of this happening. Some creatures, such as the giants and fey, are resistant to this, but humans are particularly susceptible.

## Anointed

The Anointed are those that are blessed with powers from the gods. In some parts this can manifest physically, so it is often referred to as being "marked". 

## [[Twice-Born\|Twice-Born]]

Sometimes [[Morsos\|Morsos]] will bring to the attention of a god someone who has died in a fashion they would greatly approve of. The god then gives a bit of themselves to that being, bringing them back with great powers (20th level). This is seldom done as the gift must be given freely and the power only returns with the death of the mortal. These people are known as the [[Twice-Born\|Twice-Born]].
