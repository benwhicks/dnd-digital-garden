In the desert of the [[Bilbin Spines\|Bilbin Spines]] live human-like Bilby people, called the [[Bilbin\|Bilbin]]'s. 

# Axioms
What are the unique truths about the Bilbin?

## The Viper of Leadership
Bilbin's are anarchists, in a philosophical sense. They are highly organised around family structures, and in no way would be considered chaotic, but detest authority without constant review and judgement. They see the litany of wars and disagreements between nations, peoples and religions as evidence of the foolishness of placing people in positions of power for anything longer than a very short time. If they do ever need to give others leadership roles they view this as something to be done in the very short term, a key responsibility but a dangerous burden to carry around. "Leaders carry the snake with them" is sometimes said, or "they carry the viper of leadership" - and eventually it will bite, but the poison may harm everyone around you first. They may refer to needing to "put down the serpent" when needing to finish whatever leadership role they have been cursed with. 

## Walk the sands, not the path
Bilbin's adapt to their circumstance. Just because something is usually done one way, means that it should be done that way, *this* time. Like the ever-changing dunes of the desert, one must walk according to their contours, not some idealised path that lies beneath. 

## The Resonance
Bilbins revere music, song, and story-telling. The closest thing they have to an all-seeing god is "The Resonance". When things are *just right*, in those golden moments when you are living in the best way according to the world around you, you can feel the amplification of each of your actions, building into a crescendo of contentment. This is the Resonance. Some of the Bilbin draw from this power, making magic of music and song, and are known as Resonators. 

## Beware the Great Owl - Bubuk
One of the natural predators of the Bilbin are the giant owls of the [[Wagahn Bare\|Wagahn Bare]]. The king of these is [[Bubuk the Great Owl\|Bubuk the Great Owl]], a silent and lethal predator of the bush. Bilbin use frightening stories of [[Bubuk the Great Owl\|Bubuk]] to teach their young about staying safe from the perils of the night. 

## Pouch bonds
Siblings share the mothers pouch when young. Friendships that grow into very tight relationships may be dubbed a "pouch bond".
