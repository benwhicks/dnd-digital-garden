# Character creation

## Simplified version

For introducing players to the game, or just getting started quickly, use this simplified version and [[simplified-character-sheet\|simplified-character-sheet]].

### Abilities, Class and Species

Don’t bother rolling (or even including the score), just choose where to place the modifiers: +4, +3, +2, +1, 0, -1. This takes into account rolls and modifiers from race / background. Then choose class, species and background. Take all the recommended skills were possible, and take the recommended spells unless the player has some ideas about what kind of magic they have. 
Do spend time choosing background and feats, and use these to think about the characters background. I like allowing for an extra feat at level 1 (see below) but only if the player can describe how they learned this, and from whom.

## DnD beyond settings (first page)

- *Core Rules* and *Expanded Rules* on
- *Homebrew* and *Partnered Content* on if needed.
- Optional features off. 
- Feats, Multiclass requirements on

## Level 1

### Rolling abilities

5d6 drop the two lowest to build 4 scores, one 4d6 drop the lowest and one 3d6 to build the six scores that you can assign to any ability. However if the total is 70 or less or there is no score of 15 or higher you can re-roll. 

### Backstory & Bonus Feat

#### Bonds, Ideals, Flaws

Write up your Bonds first, and this should include at least 2 people that are important to you for some reason - and at least 1 should still be alive! Even orphans form attachments that survive.

If you do this you can choose a **bonus Feat** from *any category* except the "Epic Boon" feats, however it must make sense with your backstory and how you learnt this. 

### Alignment

Alignment is for the gods and other creatures beyond the material plane. Characters and NPCs are assumed to have an alignment that emerges from their actions, and is subject to change depending on circumstance and context. 

## Languages

Just choose anything for languages on DnD beyond - they are sorted out later. I haven't worked out a good mechanism for languages yet, particularly in DnD beyond. Languages in [[Anguun\|Anguun]] are not tied to Species (i.e. "Elvish" is not a language). Once your character is created and you have a number of languages, these can be replaced by any of the [[Languages of Anguun\|Languages of Anguun]] (not ready yet!). Essentially there is one common tongue for each continent, a handful of local dialects and arcane languages, and some mystical languages associated with magical beings and realms. 

## Classes

Anything is possible, and feel free to add to this list, but here are some already established guilds, groups and variants that might inform your characters background based on your class.

> [!tip]- Artificer
> For the subclasses involved in creation of robot-like tools characters would typically hail from the order of [[Mechanalocks\|Mechanalocks]] or the more divine based [[Automatoa\|Automatoa]] creators of [[Panthos\|Panthos]]. Alchemists might be connected to any part of the [[Ovrunium Order\|Ovrunium Order]], or some other research guild. 

> [!tip]- Barbarian
> Can be adapted to anywhere, but some possible groups:
> - The [[Khunghar\|Khunghar]] or the [[Urughan Guard\|Urughan Guard]] of [[Igbele\|Igbele]] go into a trance like state of focus in battle, and are mechanically Barbarians with a 'focus' flavour rather than a wild 'rage'. 

> [!tip]- Bard
> Across the lands (everyone likes a good yarn), some potential flavours: 
> - The [[Bilbin\|Bilbin]] worship the [[Resonance\|Resonance]] and their magic is tightly associated with harmony of all kinds, particularly tone and rhythm. 
> - The [[Song mages of Ahk'ot\|Song mages of Ahk'ot]] are an order of Bards focused on voice. They are based in [[Oaxta\|Oaxta]], the kingdom of Bird-folk in [[Panthos\|Panthos]].

> [!tip]- Cleric
> Everywhere, but consider:
> - The [[Pantheon of Anguun\|Pantheon of Anguun]] for the main gods in [[Panthos\|Panthos]].
> - The [[Keldian Church\|Keldian Church]] for the lands of [[Bonnurka\|Bonnurka]].

> [!tip]- Druid

> [!tip]- Fighter

> [!tip]- Monk
> The [[Sri-Ranagu Kalhah\|Tangarene Monastery]] is one potential starting point. 

> [!tip]- Paladin

> [!tip]- Ranger

> [!tip]- Rogue

> [!tip]- Sorcerer

> [!tip]- Warlock
> Patron ideas?

> [!tip]- Wizard
> Guilds:
> - [[Ovrunium Order\|Ovrunium Order]]

# Game mechanics

## Death Saves - lingering consequences

Each failed death save adds a level of exhaustion, as long as this added exhaustion would not kill the character. This represents the severity of the wounds received by the player. Any magical healing of a HD or more removes one of these levels of exhaustion, in addition to other methods of removing exhaustion. Whilst on 0 HP and facing death saves, players can choose to take a bonus action or half movement (one only) but they incur disadvantage on their death save.
