# Character creation

## DnD beyond settings (first page)

## Backstory

### Bonds, Ideals, Flaws

### Alignment

Alignment is for the gods and other creatures beyond the material plane. Characters and NPCs are assumed to have an alignment that emerges from their actions, and is subject to change depending on circumstance and context. 

## Languages

Just choose anything for languages on DnD beyond - they are sorted out later. Languages in [[Anguun\|Anguun]] are not tied to Species (i.e. "Elvish" is not a language). Once your character is created and you have a number of languages, these can be replaced by any of the [[Languages of Anguun\|Languages of Anguun]]. Essentially there is one common tongue for each continent, a handful of local dialects and arcane languages, and some mystical languages associated with magical beings and realms. 

## Classes

Anything is possible, and feel free to add to this list, but here are some already established guilds, groups and variants that might inform your characters background based on your class.

### Artificer

For the subclasses involved in creation of robot-like tools characters would typically hail from the order of [[Mechanalocks\|Mechanalocks]] or the more divine based [[Automatoa\|Automatoa]] creators of [[Panthos\|Panthos]]. Alchemists might be connected to any part of the [[Ovrunium Order\|Ovrunium Order]], or some other research guild. 

### Barbarian

Can be adapted to anywhere, but some possible groups:
- The [[Khunghar\|Khunghar]] or the [[Urughan Guard\|Urughan Guard]] of [[Igbele\|Igbele]] go into a trance like state of focus in battle, and are mechanically Barbarians with a 'focus' flavour rather than a wild 'rage'. 

### Bard

Across the lands (everyone likes a good yarn), some potential flavours: 
- The [[Bilbin\|Bilbin]] worship the [[Resonance\|Resonance]] and their magic is tightly associated with harmony of all kinds, particularly tone and rhythm. 
- The [[Song mages of Ahk'ot\|Song mages of Ahk'ot]] are an order of Bards focused on voice. They are based in [[Oaxta\|Oaxta]], the kingdom of Bird-folk in [[Panthos\|Panthos]].

### Cleric

Everywhere, but consider:
- The [[Pantheon of Anguun\|Pantheon of Anguun]] for the main gods in [[Panthos\|Panthos]].
- The [[Keldian Church\|Keldian Church]] for the lands of [[Bonnurka\|Bonnurka]].

# Game mechanics

## Death Saves - lingering consequences

Each failed death save adds a level of exhaustion, as long as this added exhaustion would not kill the character. This represents the severity of the wounds received by the player. Any magical healing of a HD or more removes one of these levels of exhaustion, in addition to other methods of removing exhaustion. Whilst on 0 HP and facing death saves, players can choose to take a bonus action or half movement (one only) but they incur disadvantage on their death save.
