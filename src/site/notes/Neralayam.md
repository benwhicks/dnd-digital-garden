Long before the current people of [[Anguun\|Anguun]] came the [[Neralayam\|Neralayam]] inhabited the world. They typically appeared as large, fine black-scaled humanoids with four arms and large eyes, each holding multiple, shifting irises. Although master craftsmen of both the mundane, the biological and the arcane they focussed more on matters of the [[the-enduring-dream\|the-enduring-dream]], mastering their minds and psionic powers. They had developed these so intensely that the collective will of the [[Neralayam\|Neralayam]] drove all desire on [[Anguun\|Anguun]], of all beings. This collective will was called [[The Alayam\|The Alayam]]. 


## The great shame

As their interests retreated into the dream they created two other peoples to help take care of the world, the [[Kuzka\|Kuzka]] (the Crystaline) and the [[Alhadir\|Alhadir]] (the timeless ones). 

[[Alhadir\|The Timeless Ones]] were created bereft of a sense of time, but the [[Kuzka\|Kuzka]] were created to be obsessed by it. It was the [[Kuzka\|Kuzka]] that then built [[Inma\|Inma]], an immense arcane machine with the intent of seeing the future. But this obsession drove them, and [[Inma\|Inma]], to seek more data about the world. It leveraged the power of a [[3 star alignment\|3 star alignment]] to rip the worlds asunder, bringing in gods and peoples from many worlds to [[Anguun\|Anguun]]. But those falling into this world struck a note of immense psychic discord with the collective will of the [[Neralayam\|Neralayam]]: [[The Alayam\|The Alayam]]. This resulted in the times of chaos and madness, from which those beings of strongest will helped establish order and free will amongst the new people of [[Anguun\|Anguun]]. Those beings created a sanctuary, [[Panthos\|Panthos]], and called themselves [[Pantheon of Anguun\|The Pantheon]]. 

The [[Neralayam\|Neralayam]] were horrified at what they had done, and made a decision to retreat from the world. They wrote three tomes to record this, the [[Book of Hubris\|Book of Hubris]] describing why and how they created the [[Kuzka\|Kuzka]] and the [[Alhadir\|Alhadir]], the [[Book of Sunder\|Book of Sunder]] outlining the creation of [[Inma\|Inma]] and the resulting calamity, and the [[Book of Shame\|Book of Shame]] reflecting on what it meant to retreat from the world. A handful stayed on this world, entering themselves into a state of trance. They would appear as statues to any on the outside. One such [[Neralayam\|Neralayam]] is trapped in a tunnel in the western arm of [[Panthos\|Panthos]].
