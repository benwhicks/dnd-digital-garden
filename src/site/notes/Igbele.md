#place/bonnurka/igbele 

On two islands linked by bridges in the great [[Denmar\|Denmar]], a mile wide river, lies the bustling city of [[Igbele\|Igbele]], the second largest city on the continent of [[Bonnurka\|Bonnurka]]. It is home to a wide variety of races and factions, but politics is dominated by a delicate balances between the royal houses, guilds, church and criminal gangs.

> We rounded the bank in the river caravan to be met with a truly awe inspiring sight. The unbroken water of the Denmar was seemingly barred, a long thin line stretching to the western bank, broken by thin towers with immense waterwheels at regular intervals, and island city of Igbele ahead of us - cutting through the relentless current. 
> It was hard to know where to look first. The three spikes rising into the sky facing upstream, the festival of colour on the water as boats of all kinds circled for a dock, the sheer number of people traversing the great bridges, the interlocking domes of the great church, or glistening dark walls of the mages tower on the smaller island. It was then we realised that the background noise we had heard was slowly building into the voices, music and calls to prayer of the great city racing towards us across the Denmar.

# Axioms

Key truths of Igbele that make it unique.

## Succession makes no room for grief
Politics can be brutal in Igbele, particularly as heads of factions near the end of their reign. 

## Bank it upstream
The imbalance of trading or travelling upstream or downstream has a long history in Igblele. Igbelians are proud of their [[Operose Boats\|Operose Boats]] - large ships that enable travel upstream, towing a string of smaller boats behind, with their sails, oars, and the waterwheel winches for the faster flowing sections closer to [[Evermist\|Evermist]]. Once the hard work is done getting upstream, flowing down the [[Denmar\|Denmar]] is easier, hence the common attitude of getting the hard work out of the way, to 'bank it upstream'. 

## Many eyes see the truth
It is known in Igbele that you need different viewpoints to get to the truth of things. When a serious crime has occurred, a Dyad is formed - a member of the church alongside a constabulary of one of the major houses. Deeper mysterious may require a Triad, which also includes a wizard from the [[Ovrunium Order\|Ovrunium Order]]. 

## Tell your troubles to the River
Igbelians are pragmatic, and like to get on with things. Rather than burdening others with your problems, there is always the option of talking to the river Denmar and letting them flow away with the current.
