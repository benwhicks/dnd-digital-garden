Bedouin style giants of the [[White Salt Steppes\|White Salt Steppes]]. They are quiet and aloof, but travel to the [[Bilbin Spines\|Bilbin Spines]], [[Port Mern\|Port Mern]] or [[Igbele\|Igbele]] to trade salt collected from the steppes for other goods. They were part of this world long before most people arrived in [[Book of Sunder\|the Sunder]], created by the [[Neralayam\|Neralayam]] as *The Timeless Ones*. 

# Axioms
What are the unique truths of the Alhadir?

## The sacred Now
They do not, seemingly, distinguish between the past and the future. Their native language has a present tense and an other tense only. When speaking in another tongue they will frequently muddle non-present tenses around. It is rumoured that they have some capacity to see into the future - "memories of the future" - but expressing this in any meaningful way is challenging.

## Death, losing your Now
What separates life and death is now, and when an Alhadir dies they are said to have "lost their now". 

## To the pure, all things are pure
Alhadir revere purity. Their environment, high in the mountains, of wide flattened salt plains baked by the sun is washed of all but the minimal colour. They prefer silence to sound. The ever vigilant Sun is the symbol of truth and purity to the Alhadir. It is said that an Alhadir that tells an untruth may no longer speak again, becoming one of the "Voiceless". This is in stark contrast to their neighbours, the [[Bilbin\|Bilbin]], who adore bright colours, music and tall tales, but despite this contrast they tend to get along well.
