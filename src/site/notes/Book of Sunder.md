# Author
Unknown, but refers to the [[Kuzka\|Kuzka]] as 'workers'. Later revealed to be the [[Neralayam\|Neralayam]]. 

# Story

The book is broken into three parts:

1. Incoherence: A collection of epic poems about a time called [[The Incoherence\|The Incoherence]].
2. Construction: A collection of schematics and design documents around the construction of the [[Interleaved Neurological Molecular Assembly\|Interleaved Neurological Molecular Assembly]].
3. Retribution: A collection of first-person narratives of a time called [[The Retribution\|The Retribution]], where the authors are struggling to survive against an onslaught from above of epic proportions. The authors gradually retreat from the world and go into hiding, but not before the Dragons invade - traversing space from [[Darakizidar\|Darakizidar]]. 


## Incoherence

### Temporal quirks
References to [[Interleaved Neurological Molecular Assembly\|INMA]] consistently *reverse* the tense. So past tense is used when talking about something that INMA is about to do, and future tense when describing what it has done. 


## Construction
The second part of the book is no longer narrative styled, but technical and full of schematic drawings. The building of the [[Interleaved Neurological Molecular Assembly\|Interleaved Neurological Molecular Assembly]] (INMA) was deemed critical to the onset of [[The Incoherence\|The Incoherence]].  INMA was designed by the [[Kuzka\|Kuzka]] at the behest of the authors, for the purpose of foretelling. By augmenting traditional arcane magics with geometric structures aligned with the cosmos it was intended to be an autonomous divination device. 

It includes an excerpt at the end of the section:

> [!quote] INMA, last known communication
> `Insufficient data for convergent update. Priors unreliable. Divergent prior distribution likely implies dominant chaotic forces. Data search initiated. Ordering preferable.`
